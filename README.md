# DS1007_FinalProject

This is the GitHub repository for the Course Project of the 2024 DS-GA 1007 - Programming for Data Science course from the MSDS from New York University.

We use the dataset from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commision (TLC) about taxi fares in New York City for the year 2023, obtained from the official TLC data page.  Additional datasets: NYC 2023 Weather Dataset (Open Meteo Weather API), NYC Uber Rides (NYC Open Data - Rideshare dataset)

This dataset provides valuable insights into taxi fare distribution across different zones, distribution across hours, components of fares, and trip distances.  

Objective:  The primary objective of this project is to analyze the patterns in NYC taxi fares throughout 2023, identifying key factors that influence fare amounts. By assessing the impact of each variable, we aim to provide taxi drivers insights that would help them optimize their service strategy.
